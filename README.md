# CSE 29 Fall 2024 - Lab 7 Exercises

In this repository, you will find three directories each with an activity for you to complete using `gdb` or `valgrind`. The directories are as follows:

- `ctf`: This is a password cracking activity where your goal is to determine the randomly chosen password who's hash you are provided
- `gradebook`: This activity has you work with a gradebook application where the goal is to change your assignment grade using a vulnerability in how the program handles its memory.
- `valgrind`: This directory contains several buggy programs that make use of the `String` and `List` structs you have seen during the quarter. Your goal is to fix the various memory related bugs/errors in these programs to get a clean `valgrind` report.
